## Markov Model TS

Inspired by [https://github.com/susam/mvs/blob/main/mvs](https://github.com/susam/mvs/blob/main/mvs), this library is a basic implementation of a Markov model, used to generate text on a specified corpus.

### Usage

```bash
yarn dev data/seinfeld.txt #not included
```

and outputs:

```bash

He told you to put a bullet through it this woman in our hallway wearing one of his right side. He can't drink. He's an importer. Just imports? No exports? He's an importer/exporter, okay?
